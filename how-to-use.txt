There are two main ways to get the TypeScript tools:

> Via npm (the Node.js package manager)
> By installing TypeScriptâ€™s Visual Studio plugins

For NPM users:
> npm install -g typescript

At the command line, run the TypeScript compiler:
> tsc greeter.ts // greeter.ts - is a name of a file with code
